title: "Older job position"
sub: "Older company"

Or even end date. Or any of the optional parameters of the **Entry** component like:

- `subLink?: string;`
- `startDate?: string;`
- `endDate?: string | "present";`

You can omit **title** and **sub** too, and it would not error out, hmph, I should fix this probably...
